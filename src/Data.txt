Lets make an App on which we can see proce of cryptocurrency

1. Get current price of all crypto coins w.r.t to one trading app. eg - coinbase

    - GET https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/assets
    - GET https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets ..... for line chart
    - GET https://developers.shrimpy.io/docs/#get-candles .... for candles chart

2. After getting all assets, display the assets in scroll bar showing there name, current price and 24H change percentage.
    
    2.1 Every row of asset is assigned unique symbol of respective of coin. For ex - for bitcoin Key would be "btc"

3. When we click on "coin name" we fetch the coin id ann coin name and pass this details to request the data for that particular coin details.

4. There will be two options to study the trend of that coin, one would be Line chart and Another would be candlesticks.
